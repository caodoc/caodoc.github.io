# Greeting!

Is this your first time to this page? Don't worry, this is **caodoc** and welcome to ***caodoc's not a very complicated page*** for random things which I think are interesting.

A little bit about myself, I'm a hobbyist programmer who love to explore modern technologies.
I'm currently learning front-end development.
